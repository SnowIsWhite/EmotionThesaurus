Fit someone like a glove

Get a handle on something

Get a slap on the wrist

Go hand in hand

Have something down pat

Hear something through the grapevine

Hit the nail on the head

Keep someone in the dark

Keep something at bay

Leave someone in the lurch

Let someone off the hook

Make no bones about something

Nip something in the bud

Open doors for someone

Place something on a pedestal

Play something by ear

Pull rank on someone

Put a damper on something

Put someone on the spot

Put something on the map

Read someone like a book

Run something into the ground

Shout something from the rooftops

Take something by storm

Take the edge off something

Throw someone off balance

Treat someone like dirt

Watch someone like a hawk

Write the book on something
