r.  i declared i
could not change: you tell me to my face i shall change soon.  and what a
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
by your conduct!  is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
by living with me?"

this was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  they
spoke almost as loud as feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "oh,
comply!" it said.  "think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
him you love him and will be his.  who in the world cares for _you_? or
who will be injured by what you do?"

still indomitable was the reply--"_i_ care for myself.  the more
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained i am, the more i will
respect myself.  i will keep the law given by god; sanctioned by man.  i
will hold to the principles received by me when i was sane, and not
mad--as i am now.  laws and principles are not for the times when there
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
shall be.  if at my individual convenience i might break them, what would
be their worth?  they have a worth--so i have always believed; and if i
cannot believe it now, it is because i am insane--quite insane: with my
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than i can count its
throbs.  preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all i have
at this hour to stand by: there i plant my foot."

i did.  mr. rochester, reading my countenance, saw i had done so.  his
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
waist.  he seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, i
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
of a furnace: mentally, i still possessed my soul, and with it the
certainty of ultimate safety.  the soul, fortunately, has an
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
the eye.  my eye rose to his; and while i looked in his fierce face i
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
strength almost exhausted.

"never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
frail and so indomitable.  a mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (and he
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "i could bend her with my finger
and thumb: and what good would it do if i bent, if i uptore, if i crushed
her?  consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
whatever i do with its cage, i cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
creature!  if i tear, if i rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
let the captive loose.  conqueror i might be of the house; but the inmate
would escape to heaven before i could call myself possessor of its clay
dwelling-place.  and it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
and purity--that i want: not alone your brittle frame.  of yourself you
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
will vanish ere i inhale your fragrance.  oh! come, jane, come!"

as he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
the look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
however, would have succumbed now.  i had dared and baffled his fury; i
must elude his sorrow: i retired to the door.

"you are going, jane?"

"i am going, sir."

"you are leaving me?"

"yes."

"you will not come?  you will not be my comforter, my rescuer


======================================================


ne!--a
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  you must open
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
little glass you will find there,--quick!"

i flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.

"that's well!  now, doctor, i shall take the liberty of administering a
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  i got this cordial at rome, of an
italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, carter.  it is not a
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
for instance.  jane, a little water."

he held out the tiny glass, and i half filled it from the water-bottle on
the washstand.

"that will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."

i did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
to mason.

"drink, richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."

"but will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"

"drink! drink! drink!"

mr. mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  he was
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
mr. rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
liquid; he then took his arm--

"now i am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."

the patient rose.

"carter, take him under the other shoulder.  be of good cheer, richard;
step out--that's it!"

"i do feel better," remarked mr. mason.

"i am sure you do.  now, jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
will see in the yard--or just outside, for i told him not to drive his
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, jane,
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."

it was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
rising; but i found the kitchen still dark and silent.  the side-passage
door was fastened; i opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
stationed outside.  i approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
he nodded: then i looked carefully round and listened.  the stillness of
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.

the gentlemen now appeared.  mason, supported by mr. rochester and the
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
chaise; carter followed.

"take care of him," said mr. rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
your house till he is quite well: i shall ride over in a day or two to
see how he gets on.  richard, how is it with you?"

"the fresh air revives me, fairfax."

"leave the window open on his side, carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
dick."

"fairfax--"

"well what is it?"

"let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.

"i do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.

"yet would to god there was an end of all this!" added mr. rochester, as
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.

this done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
the wall bordering the orchard.  i, supposing he had done with me,
prepared to return to the house; again, however, i heard him call "jane!"
he had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.

"come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"

"it seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."

"the glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
see it through a charmed medium

chapter viii.

noah and moses.


the next day moore had risen before the sun, and had taken a ride to
whinbury and back ere his sister had made the café au lait or cut the
tartines for his breakfast. what business he transacted there he kept to
himself. hortense asked no questions: it was not her wont to comment on
his movements, nor his to render an account of them. the secrets of
business--complicated and often dismal mysteries--were buried in his
breast, and never came out of their sepulchre save now and then to scare
joe scott, or give a start to some foreign correspondent. indeed, a
general habit of reserve on whatever was important seemed bred in his
mercantile blood.

breakfast over, he went to his counting-house. henry, joe scott's boy,
brought in the letters and the daily papers; moore seated himself at his
desk, broke the seals of the documents, and glanced them over. they were
all short, but not, it seemed, sweet--probably rather sour, on the
contrary, for as moore laid down the last, his nostrils emitted a
derisive and defiant snuff, and though he burst into no soliloquy, there
was a glance in his eye which seemed to invoke the devil, and lay
charges on him to sweep the whole concern to gehenna. however, having
chosen a pen and stripped away the feathered top in a brief spasm of
finger-fury (only finger-fury--his face was placid), he dashed off a
batch of answers, sealed them, and then went out and walked through the
mill. on coming back he sat down to read his newspaper.

the contents seemed not absorbingly interesting; he more than once laid
it across his knee, folded his arms, and gazed into the fire; he
occasionally turned his head towards the window; he looked at intervals
at his watch; in short, his mind appeared preoccupied. perhaps he was
thinking of the beauty of the weather--for it was a fine and mild
morning for the season--and wishing to be out in the fields enjoying
it. the door of his counting-house stood wide open. the breeze and
sunshine entered freely; but the first visitant brought no spring
perfume on its wings, only an occasional sulphur-puff from the
soot-thick column of smoke rushing sable from the gaunt mill-chimney.

a dark-blue apparition (that of joe scott, fresh from a dyeing vat)
appeared momentarily at the open door, uttered the words "he's comed,
sir," and vanished.

mr. moore raised not his eyes from the paper. a large man,
broad-shouldered and massive-limbed, clad in fustian garments and gray
worsted stockings, entered, who was received with a nod, and desired to
take a seat, which he did, making the remark, as he removed his hat (a
very bad one), stowed it away under his chair, and wiped his forehead
with a spotted cotton handkerchief extracted from the hat-crown, that it
was "raight dahn warm for febewerry." mr. moore assented--at least he
uttered some slight sound, which, though inarticulate, might pass for an
assent. the visitor now carefully deposited in the corner beside him an
official-looking staff which he bore in his hand; this done, he
whistled, probably by way of appearing at his ease.

"you have what is necessary, i suppose?" said mr. moore.

"ay, ay! all's right."

he renewed his whistling, mr. moore his reading. the paper apparently
had become more interesting. presently, however, he turned to his
cupboard, which was within reach of his long arm, opened it without
rising, took out a black bottle--the same he had produced for malone's
benefit--a tumbler, and a jug, placed them on the table, and said to his
guest,--

"help yourself; there's water in that jar in the corner."

"i dunnut knaw that there's mich need, for all a body is dry (thirsty)
in a morning," said the fustian gentleman, rising and doing as
requested.

"will you tak naught yourseln, mr. moore?" he inquired, as with skilled
hand he mixed a portion, and having tested it by a deep draught, sank
back satisfied and bland in his seat. moore, chary of words, replied by
a negative m


======================================================


ost unique degree, the power of keeping
order amongst her undisciplined ranks of scholars. a certain petrifying
influence accompanied and surrounded her: without passion, noise, or
violence, she held them in check as a breezeless frost-air might still
a brawling stream. she was of little use as far as communication of
knowledge went, but for strict surveillance and maintenance of rules
she was invaluable. "je sais bien qu'elle n'a pas de principes, ni,
peut-être, de moeurs," admitted madame frankly; but added with
philosophy, "son maintien en classe est toujours convenable et rempli
même d'une certaine dignité: c'est tout ce qu'il faut. ni les élèves ni
les parents ne regardent plus loin; ni, par conséquent, moi non plus."

       *       *       *       *       *

a strange, frolicsome, noisy little world was this school: great pains
were taken to hide chains with flowers: a subtle essence of romanism
pervaded every arrangement: large sensual indulgence (so to speak) was
permitted by way of counterpoise to jealous spiritual restraint. each
mind was being reared in slavery; but, to prevent reflection from
dwelling on this fact, every pretext for physical recreation was seized
and made the most of. there, as elsewhere, the church strove to bring
up her children robust in body, feeble in soul, fat, ruddy, hale,
joyous, ignorant, unthinking, unquestioning. "eat, drink, and live!"
she says. "look after your bodies; leave your souls to me. i hold their
cure--guide their course: i guarantee their final fate." a bargain, in
which every true catholic deems himself a gainer. lucifer just offers
the same terms: "all this power will i give thee, and the glory of it;
for that is delivered unto me, and to whomsoever i will i give it. if
thou, therefore, wilt worship me, all shall be thine!"

about this time--in the ripest glow of summer--madame beck's house
became as merry a place as a school could well be. all day long the
broad folding-doors and the two-leaved casements stood wide open:
settled sunshine seemed naturalized in the atmosphere; clouds were far
off, sailing away beyond sea, resting, no doubt, round islands such as
england--that dear land of mists--but withdrawn wholly from the drier
continent. we lived far more in the garden than under a roof: classes
were held, and meals partaken of, in the "grand berceau." moreover,
there was a note of holiday preparation, which almost turned freedom
into licence. the autumnal long vacation was but two months distant;
but before that, a great day--an important ceremony--none other than
the fête of madame--awaited celebration.

the conduct of this fête devolved chiefly on mademoiselle st. pierre:
madame herself being supposed to stand aloof, disinterestedly
unconscious of what might be going forward in her honour. especially,
she never knew, never in the least suspected, that a subscription was
annually levied on the whole school for the purchase of a handsome
present. the polite tact of the reader will please to leave out of the
account a brief, secret consultation on this point in madame's own
chamber.

"what will you have this year?" was asked by her parisian lieutenant.

"oh, no matter! let it alone. let the poor children keep their francs,"
and madame looked benign and modest.

the st. pierre would here protrude her chin; she knew madame by heart;
she always called her airs of "bonté"--"des grimaces." she never even
professed to respect them one instant.

"vite!" she would say coldly. "name the article. shall it be jewellery
or porcelain, haberdashery or silver?"

"eh bien! deux ou trois cuillers, et autant de fourchettes en argent."

and the result was a handsome case, containing 300 francs worth of
plate.

the programme of the fête-day's proceedings comprised: presentation of
plate, collation in the garden, dramatic performance (with pupils and
teachers for actors), a dance and supper. very gorgeous seemed the
effect of the whole to me, as i well remember. zélie st. pierre
understood

t splendid creature in the pale
blue satin dress, and hair of paler brown, with 'reflets satinés' as
those of her robe. would you not feel proud, mamma, if i were to bring
that goddess home some day, and introduce her to you as mrs. bretton,
junior?"

"you will bring no goddess to la terrasse: that little château will not
contain two mistresses; especially if the second be of the height,
bulk, and circumference of that mighty doll in wood and wax, and kid
and satin."

"mamma, she would fill your blue chair so admirably!"

"fill my chair? i defy the foreign usurper! a rueful chair should it be
for her: but hush, john graham! hold your tongue, and use your eyes."

during the above skirmish, the hall, which, i had thought, seemed full
at the entrance, continued to admit party after party, until the
semicircle before the stage presented one dense mass of heads, sloping
from floor to ceiling. the stage, too, or rather the wide temporary
platform, larger than any stage, desert half an hour since, was now
overflowing with life; round two grand pianos, placed about the centre,
a white flock of young girls, the pupils of the conservatoire, had
noiselessly poured. i had noticed their gathering, while graham and his
mother were engaged in discussing the belle in blue satin, and had
watched with interest the process of arraying and marshalling them. two
gentlemen, in each of whom i recognised an acquaintance, officered this
virgin troop. one, an artistic-looking man, bearded, and with long
hair, was a noted pianiste, and also the first music-teacher in
villette; he attended twice a week at madame beck's pensionnat, to give
lessons to the few pupils whose parents were rich enough to allow their
daughters the privilege of his instructions; his name was m. josef
emanuel, and he was half-brother to m. paul: which potent personage was
now visible in the person of the second gentleman.

m. paul amused me; i smiled to myself as i watched him, he seemed so
thoroughly in his element--standing conspicuous in presence of a wide
and grand assemblage, arranging, restraining, over-aweing about one
hundred young ladies. he was, too, so perfectly in earnest--so
energetic, so intent, and, above all, so absolute: and yet what
business had he there? what had he to do with music or the
conservatoire--he who could hardly distinguish one note from another? i
knew that it was his love of display and authority which had brought
him there--a love not offensive, only because so naive. it presently
became obvious that his brother, m. josef, was as much under his
control as were the girls themselves. never was such a little hawk of a
man as that m. paul! ere long, some noted singers and musicians dawned
upon the platform: as these stars rose, the comet-like professor set.
insufferable to him were all notorieties and celebrities: where he
could not outshine, he fled.

and now all was prepared: but one compartment of the hall waited to be
filled--a compartment covered with crimson, like the grand staircase
and doors, furnished with stuffed and cushioned benches, ranged on each
side of two regal chairs, placed solemnly under a canopy.

a signal was given, the doors rolled back, the assembly stood up, the
orchestra burst out, and, to the welcome of a choral burst, enter the
king, the queen, the court of labassecour.

till then, i had never set eyes on living king or queen; it may
consequently be conjectured how i strained my powers of vision to take
in these specimens of european royalty. by whomsoever majesty is beheld
for the first time, there will always be experienced a vague surprise
bordering on disappointment, that the same does not appear seated, en
permanence, on a throne, bonneted with a crown, and furnished, as to
the hand, with a sceptre. looking out for a king and queen, and seeing
only a middle-aged soldier and a rather young lady, i felt half
cheated, half pleased.

well do i recall that king--a man of fifty, a little bowed, a little
grey: there was no face in all that assembly which resembled 


======================================================


ng senses she made the glimmering gloom, the narrow limits,
the oppressive heat of the dormitory, intolerable. she lured me to
leave this den and follow her forth into dew, coolness, and glory.

she brought upon me a strange vision of villette at midnight.
especially she showed the park, the summer-park, with its long alleys
all silent, lone and safe; among these lay a huge stone basin--that
basin i knew, and beside which i had often stood--deep-set in the
tree-shadows, brimming with cool water, clear, with a green, leafy,
rushy bed. what of all this? the park-gates were shut up, locked,
sentinelled: the place could not be entered.

could it not? a point worth considering; and while revolving it, i
mechanically dressed. utterly incapable of sleeping or lying
still--excited from head to foot--what could i do better than dress?

the gates were locked, soldiers set before them: was there, then, no
admission to the park?

the other day, in walking past, i had seen, without then attending to
the circumstance, a gap in the paling--one stake broken down: i now saw
this gap again in recollection--saw it very plainly--the narrow,
irregular aperture visible between the stems of the lindens, planted
orderly as a colonnade. a man could not have made his way through that
aperture, nor could a stout woman, perhaps not madame beck; but i
thought i might: i fancied i should like to try, and once within, at
this hour the whole park would be mine--the moonlight, midnight park!

how soundly the dormitory slept! what deep slumbers! what quiet
breathing! how very still the whole large house! what was the time? i
felt restless to know. there stood a clock in the classe below: what
hindered me from venturing down to consult it? by such a moon, its
large white face and jet black figures must be vividly distinct.

as for hindrance to this step, there offered not so much as a creaking
hinge or a clicking latch. on these hot july nights, close air could
not be tolerated, and the chamber-door stood wide open. will the
dormitory-planks sustain my tread untraitorous? yes. i know wherever a
board is loose, and will avoid it. the oak staircase creaks somewhat as
i descend, but not much:--i am in the carré.

the great classe-doors are close shut: they are bolted. on the other
hand, the entrance to the corridor stands open. the classes seem to my
thought, great dreary jails, buried far back beyond thoroughfares, and
for me, filled with spectral and intolerable memories, laid miserable
amongst their straw and their manacles. the corridor offers a cheerful
vista, leading to the high vestibule which opens direct upon the street.

hush!--the clock strikes. ghostly deep as is the stillness of this
convent, it is only eleven. while my ear follows to silence the hum of
the last stroke, i catch faintly from the built-out capital, a sound
like bells or like a band--a sound where sweetness, where victory,
where mourning blend. oh, to approach this music nearer, to listen to
it alone by the rushy basin! let me go--oh, let me go! what hinders,
what does not aid freedom?

there, in the corridor, hangs my garden-costume, my large hat, my
shawl. there is no lock on the huge, heavy, porte-cochère; there is no
key to seek: it fastens with a sort of spring-bolt, not to be opened
from the outside, but which, from within, may be noiselessly withdrawn.
can i manage it? it yields to my hand, yields with propitious facility.
i wonder as that portal seems almost spontaneously to unclose--i wonder
as i cross the threshold and step on the paved street, wonder at the
strange ease with which this prison has been forced. it seems as if i
had been pioneered invisibly, as if some dissolving force had gone
before me: for myself, i have scarce made an effort.

quiet rue fossette! i find on this pavement that wanderer-wooing summer
night of which i mused; i see its moon over me; i feel its dew in the
air. but here i cannot stay; i am still too near old haunts: so close
under the dungeon, i can hear th

 all could join.  the sound drew the
listening woman.  how often when weary of imaginary companions had she
run up the lane and joined her cousins at their play!  hember had been a
bright spot in her life.  all that she knew of sewing and housewifery,
her aunt had taught her; and tom had wanted to marry her, yes—tom and
constantine.  poor old constantine, he had tried his best.  but tom, the
rascal, tom had been looking two ways at once.  she sighed, the gusty
sigh of a stout middle-aged woman who wishes the hot cake of youthful
joys, with its plums and its citron and its spice, was once more whole
in her hand.

a puff of wind, increasing the volume of sound, enabled sabina to
recognize the hymn.  she could almost see the happy group, isolda
knitting in her chair by the range, tom opposite to her and, about the
harmonium, the bright heads and smiling faces of the girls.  ah, if only
one of them had been born to herself!  she, who had been going to ’full
the rooms,’ had had neither the full quiver nor the faithful mate; she
had had, as she realized at last, nothing in all her life but hope; and
from her, time had stolen, even that which she had.

in the kitchen, absorbed in brooding thought, byron, a thicker shadow in
the growing gloom, was awaiting her return.  her mind, from wandering
far afield, circled to the present, to the slight repugnance she felt at
entering the house.  she was not a ’nervy’ woman, indeed, in a
countryside peculiarly susceptible to the so-called supernatural, had
been known to declare, "out at all times, night and day, and never see
nothing worse than myself."  her unwillingness to go back, an
unwillingness which, in truth, was but another of the warnings which had
been tolling like death-bells all the day, seemed to her foolish.

"’tis owin’ that we’ve been bad friends for so long," she said.  "i’m
feelin’ awkward as tho’ ’e’d been a stranger. the sooner i take an’ go
in the better."

the door of the glass porch stood wide in a yawn of blackness, a
blackness so thick that mrs. byron felt as if she were pushing her way
in against a resistance intangible and, on the whole, yielding but which
could yet be felt. afraid of what might be lurking in the depths of that
gloom she forced herself to move noisily and, making a greater effort,
to break the silence.

"’tis darker ’ere than ’tis in the yard," she said, thinking of the
moon, and the pale flood it was pouring over meadow and common, over the
nestling farms, over every place but the dark corner in which her home
lay hid; contrasting the black and silver of the night with this
brooding hush.

she put her hand on the shelf to find the matches. once the lamp was
lighted, once its cheery beams had driven out the dark, she would be
more at ease.  in a hurry to finish her work, gray however, had
forgotten to fill the brass receptacle with oil and mrs. byron was faced
with a domestic problem.  to manoeuvre the trolly sufficiently close to
the wall would be difficult. nevertheless it did not occur to her to ask
leadville’s help and he, sitting motionless by the window, did not offer
it.

"strange ’ow i feel i must keep on craikin’," she thought, as, at last
successful, she trundled off to the linhay.  "’tis just like leadville
’ad now comed in and i must talk to’n.  i dunno when i felt so whisht."

"we ’aven’t got very much paraffin left," she said aloud as she returned
with the lamp.  "jim didn’t bring any. i dare say we got enough for
to-night though, we don’t burn much."

"where’s jim to?" asked leadville suddenly.

"couldn’t get a bit of coal," said mrs. byron, hanging the lamp in its
bracket and trying to conceal the fact that his unexpected utterance had
jarred her unruly nerves.  "’awken ’adn’t a bit, but the boat is
expected in to-night so jim’ll ’av to go in to-morrow and fetch it."

"where’s ’e to?" persisted leadville.

sabina held that if no fuel were thrown upon a fire, that fire must d

unthinkable.”
“and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”
“no.”
“and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane?”
“very much so.”
“was the window open?”
“yes.”
“then he might have called to you?”
“he might.”
“he only, as i understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”
“yes.”
“a call for help, you thought?”
“yes. he waved his hands.”
“but it might have been a cry of surprise. astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”
“it is possible.”
“and you thought he was pulled back?”
“he disappeared so suddenly.”
“he might have leaped back. you did not see anyone else in the room?”
“no, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs.”
“quite so. your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?”
“but without his collar or tie. i distinctly saw his bare throat.”
“had he ever spoken of swandam lane?”
“never.”
“had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”
“never.”
“thank you, mrs. st. clair. those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear. we shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”
a large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and i was quickly between the sheets, for i was weary after my night of adventure. sherlock holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. he took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. so he sat as i dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment. the pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night.
“awake, watson?” he asked.
“yes.”
“game for a morning drive?”
“certainly.”
“then dress. no one is stirring yet, but i know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” he chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
as i dressed i glanced at my watch. it was no wonder that no one was stirring. it was twenty-five minutes past four. i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.
“i want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his boots. “i think, watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe. i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross. but i think i have the key of the affair now.”
“and where is it?” i asked, smiling.
“in the bathroom,” he answered. “oh, yes, i am not joking,” he continued, seeing my look of incredulity. “i have just been there, and i have taken it out, and i have got it in this gladstone bag. come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”
we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. in the road stood our horse and trap, with the hal

ant."

i hid my face with the book, for it was covered with tears. i asked him
why he talked so; and he said he would talk so no more, and cheered me
again with the kindest encouragement. still, the gentleness with which
he treated me during the rest of the day, went somehow to my heart. it
was too tender. it was mournful. i would rather he had been abrupt,
whimsical, and irate as was his wont.

when hot noon arrived--for the day turned out as we had anticipated,
glowing as june--our shepherd collected his sheep from the pasture, and
proceeded to lead us all softly home. but we had a whole league to
walk, thus far from villette was the farm where he had breakfasted; the
children, especially, were tired with their play; the spirits of most
flagged at the prospect of this mid-day walk over chaussées flinty,
glaring, and dusty. this state of things had been foreseen and provided
for. just beyond the boundary of the farm we met two spacious vehicles
coming to fetch us--such conveyances as are hired out purposely for the
accommodation of school-parties; here, with good management, room was
found for all, and in another hour m. paul made safe consignment of his
charge at the rue fossette. it had been a pleasant day: it would have
been perfect, but for the breathing of melancholy which had dimmed its
sunshine a moment.

that tarnish was renewed the same evening.

just about sunset, i saw m. emanuel come out of the front-door,
accompanied by madame beck. they paced the centre-alley for nearly an
hour, talking earnestly: he--looking grave, yet restless; she--wearing
an amazed, expostulatory, dissuasive air.

i wondered what was under discussion; and when madame beck re-entered
the house as it darkened, leaving her kinsman paul yet lingering in the
garden, i said to myself--"he called me 'petite soeur' this morning. if
he were really my brother, how i should like to go to him just now, and
ask what it is that presses on his mind. see how he leans against that
tree, with his arms crossed and his brow bent. he wants consolation, i
know: madame does not console: she only remonstrates. what now----?"

starting from quiescence to action, m. paul came striding erect and
quick down the garden. the carré doors were yet open: i thought he was
probably going to water the orange-trees in the tubs, after his
occasional custom; on reaching the court, however, he took an abrupt
turn and made for the berceau and the first-classe glass door. there,
in that first classe i was, thence i had been watching him; but there i
could not find courage to await his approach. he had turned so
suddenly, he strode so fast, he looked so strange; the coward within me
grew pale, shrank and--not waiting to listen to reason, and hearing the
shrubs crush and the gravel crunch to his advance--she was gone on the
wings of panic.

nor did i pause till i had taken sanctuary in the oratory, now empty.
listening there with beating pulses, and an unaccountable, undefined
apprehension, i heard him pass through all the schoolrooms, clashing
the doors impatiently as he went; i heard him invade the refectory
which the "lecture pieuse" was now holding under hallowed constraint; i
heard him pronounce these words--"où est mademoiselle lucie?"

and just as, summoning my courage, i was preparing to go down and do
what, after all, i most wished to do in the world--viz., meet him--the
wiry voice of st. pierre replied glibly and falsely, "elle est au lit."
and he passed, with the stamp of vexation, into the corridor. there
madame beck met, captured, chid, convoyed to the street-door, and
finally dismissed him.

as that street-door closed, a sudden amazement at my own perverse
proceeding struck like a blow upon me. i felt from the first it was me
he wanted--me he was seeking--and had not i wanted him too? what, then,
had carried me away? what had rapt me beyond his reach? he had
something to tell: he was going to tell me that something: my ear
strained its nerve to hear it, and i had made the confide

are of it; so i kept still.

presently, sure enough, we went sailing by that plantation. captain
klinefelter appeared on the deck, and said--

‘let her come around, sir, let her come around. didn’t henry tell you to
land here?’

‘_no_, sir!’

‘i sent him up to do, it.’

‘he did come up; and that’s all the good it done, the dod-derned fool.
he never said anything.’

‘didn’t _you _hear him?’ asked the captain of me.

of course i didn’t want to be mixed up in this business, but there was
no way to avoid it; so i said--

‘yes, sir.’

i knew what brown’s next remark would be, before he uttered it; it was--

‘shut your mouth! you never heard anything of the kind.’

i closed my mouth according to instructions. an hour later, henry
entered the pilot-house, unaware of what had been going on. he was a
thoroughly inoffensive boy, and i was sorry to see him come, for i knew
brown would have no pity on him. brown began, straightway--

‘here! why didn’t you tell me we’d got to land at that plantation?’

‘i did tell you, mr. brown.’

‘it’s a lie!’

i said--

‘you lie, yourself. he did tell you.’

brown glared at me in unaffected surprise; and for as much as a moment
he was entirely speechless; then he shouted to me--

‘i’ll attend to your case in half a minute!’ then to henry, ‘and you
leave the pilot-house; out with you!’

it was pilot law, and must be obeyed. the boy started out, and even had
his foot on the upper step outside the door, when brown, with a sudden
access of fury, picked up a ten-pound lump of coal and sprang after him;
but i was between, with a heavy stool, and i hit brown a good honest
blow which stretched-him out.

i had committed the crime of crimes--i had lifted my hand against a
pilot on duty! i supposed i was booked for the penitentiary sure, and
couldn’t be booked any surer if i went on and squared my long account
with this person while i had the chance; consequently i stuck to him and
pounded him with my fists a considerable time--i do not know how long,
the pleasure of it probably made it seem longer than it really was;--but
in the end he struggled free and jumped up and sprang to the wheel: a
very natural solicitude, for, all this time, here was this steamboat
tearing down the river at the rate of fifteen miles an hour and nobody
at the helm! however, eagle bend was two miles wide at this bank-full
stage, and correspondingly long and deep; and the boat was steering
herself straight down the middle and taking no chances. still, that was
only luck--a body _might _have found her charging into the woods.

perceiving, at a glance, that the ‘pennsylvania’ was in no danger, brown
gathered up the big spy-glass, war-club fashion, and ordered me out of
the pilot-house with more than comanche bluster. but i was not afraid of
him now; so, instead of going, i tarried, and criticized his grammar; i
reformed his ferocious speeches for him, and put them into good english,
calling his attention to the advantage of pure english over the bastard
dialect of the pennsylvanian collieries whence he was extracted.
he could have done his part to admiration in a cross-fire of mere
vituperation, of course; but he was not equipped for this species of
controversy; so he presently laid aside his glass and took the wheel,
muttering and shaking his head; and i retired to the bench. the racket
had brought everybody to the hurricane deck, and i trembled when i
saw the old captain looking up from the midst of the crowd. i said
to myself, ‘now i _am_ done for!’--for although, as a rule, he was so
fatherly and indulgent toward the boat’s family, and so patient of minor
shortcomings, he could be stern enough when the fault was worth it.

i tried to imagine what he _would _do to a cub pilot who had been guilty
of such a crime as mine, committed on a boat guard-deep with costly
freight and alive with passengers. our watch was nearly ended. i thought
i would go and hide somewhere till i got a chance
